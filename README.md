### 🚀 Hello there! I'm Angel. 🚀

 - 💼 I'm an Associate Graphics Programmer at [Rockstar North](https://www.rockstargames.com/careers/).
 - ☀️ Unsurprisingly obsessed with everything light related.
 - 🐱 Please send me your cat pics [here.](https://twitter.com/aortizelguero)
 - 🚀 Also, [rockets](https://media.wired.com/photos/5933242f26780e6c04d2e81b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ASTP_Saturn_IB.jpg) are the coolest things we've built.
 - ✍️ I write [blog posts](http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html) at a rate of 0.5 per year. //TODO: improve latency
 - 🧙 I'm happiest when writing shaders and doing low level programming.
 - ⛰️ Just trying to get a little bit better at this every day.
