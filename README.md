### 🚀 Hello there! I'm Angel. 🚀

 - 💼 I'm an Associate Graphics Programmer at Rockstar North.
 - ☀️ Unsurprisingly obsessed with everything light related.
 - 🐱 Please send me your cat pics [here.](https://twitter.com/aortizelguero)
 - 🚀 Also, rockets are the coolest things we've built.
 - ✍️ I write blog posts at a rate of 0.5 posts per year. //TODO: improve latency
 - 🧙 I'm happiest when writing shaders and doing low level C programming.
 - ⛰️ Just trying to get a little bit better at this every day.
